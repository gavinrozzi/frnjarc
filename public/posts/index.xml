      <description>Last month, the Hugo developers released version 0.30 of Hugo. The big-ticket items mentioned in the release notes were the new fast render mode, improvements to template metrics, and improvements to the built-in syntax highlighting.
Another feature added, that was left underneath the release announcement, was the addition of the errorf template function. It seems like a small thing, but has huge implications: it means that theme developers can now safely tell users that they&amp;rsquo;ve misconfigured their theme!</description>

      <title>BluestNight is All Grown Up!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 20th, 2017, I made the first commit in the BluestNight repository. Back then, BluestNight was little more than my attempt to create a cleaner-written version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad&#34;&gt;Mainroad&lt;/a&gt; theme after I grew frustrated with maintaining the fork I made, named &amp;ldquo;Darkroad&amp;rdquo; (it was a dark version of Mainroad).&lt;/p&gt;
