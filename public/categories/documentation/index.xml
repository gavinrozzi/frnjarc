      <description>The Forked River Amateur Radio Club makes use of several frequencies to communicate over amateur radio. Please program your radios with the frequencies listed in this table if you wish to communicate with our members and participate in club activities. The Club may also utilize other public repeaters or traditional calling frequencies at our discretion.
We are currently making use of simplex frequencies for radio contact within the Lacey area. Our members are in the process of migrating to DMR digital radios to supplement analog communications.</description>
