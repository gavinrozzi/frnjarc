The Forked River Amateur Radio Club will hold its first meeting on the morning of Saturday, June 23rd at 11:00 AM.

Please bring your own radio equipment and folding chairs. We will discuss some of our goals for the club and how membmers will be able to participate going forward. The first meeting will largely be informal and a chance for members to get an idea of our vision for the club and what we hope to accomplish. All licensed radio amateurs, as well as those who are not yet licensed but have an interest in radio, will be welcome to attend the first meeting.

The meeting will be held at the home of Jim Bangert, KB2UNK, located at 259 Station Drive, Forked River. Club members will be monitoring the **Forked River Simplex 1** channel (146.500 MHz) during the event in case there are any questions.

No dues are required to attend the meeting, however contributions of resources and equipment will be gratefully accepted as they will be used to further club operations.
