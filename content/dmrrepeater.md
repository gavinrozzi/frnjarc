The Forked River Amateur Radio Club plans on building out our own DMR repeater.
We have registered the callsign **KA2DMR** for this repeater. We have a site in Forked River available
for the repeater and are in the process of obtaining the parts.

This is going to be a homebrew repeater constructed using two Motorola Maxtrac radios and an MMDVM to provide the
digital voice capabilities.

This project is being headed up by KD2CXZ and KB2UNK.
